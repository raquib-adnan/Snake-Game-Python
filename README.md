# Snake Game in Python

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Java. The game involves controlling a snake that grows in length every time it eats food. The objective is to avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body while trying to achieve the highest score possible.

## Features
- **Basic Gameplay:** Control the snake using the arrow keys.
- **Score Tracking:** The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases with each piece of food eaten.
- **Game Over:** The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
- **Restart Game:** After a game over, the player can restart the game to try for a higher score.

     - **Right Arrow (→):** Move the snake right.

3. **Objective:**
